summary differential diagnosis of anxiety disorders";"The DSM-5 categorizes anxiety disorders into several distinct types, each with specific diagnostic criteria and key symptoms that help differentiate them. Hereâ€™s an overview of the main categories:

1. **Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD)**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Excessive anxiety and worry occurring more days than not for at least six months, difficulty controlling the worry, and associated symptoms such as restlessness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating, irritability, muscle tension, and sleep disturbances.

2. **Panic Disorder**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Recurrent unexpected panic attacks, which are sudden surges of intense fear or discomfort that peak within minutes. Symptoms include palpitations, sweating, trembling, shortness of breath, feelings of choking, chest pain, nausea, dizziness, chills, or fear of losing control or dying. The presence of persistent concern about having more attacks or significant behavioral changes related to the attacks is also necessary.

3. **Specific Phobia**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Marked fear or anxiety about a specific object or situation (e.g., heights, animals, injections) that is out of proportion to the actual danger posed. The phobic stimulus almost always provokes immediate fear or anxiety and is actively avoided or endured with intense fear or anxiety.

4. **Social Anxiety Disorder (Social Phobia)**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Marked fear or anxiety about one or more social situations in which the individual is exposed to possible scrutiny by others. Symptoms include fear of acting in a way that will be negatively evaluated, leading to avoidance of social situations or enduring them with intense anxiety.

5. **Agoraphobia**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Marked fear or anxiety about two or more of the following situations: using public transportation, being in open spaces, being in enclosed places, standing in line or being in a crowd, or being outside of the home alone. The individual fears or avoids these situations due to thoughts that escape might be difficult or help might not be available in the event of a panic attack or other incapacitating symptoms.

6. **Separation Anxiety Disorder**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Developmentally inappropriate and excessive fear or anxiety concerning separation from those to whom the individual is attached. Symptoms include persistent worry about losing attachment figures, refusal to go out due to fear of separation, nightmares about separation, and physical symptoms when separation occurs or is anticipated.

7. **Selective Mutism**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Consistently not speaking in specific social situations (e.g., at school or with playmates) where there is an expectation to speak, despite speaking in other situations (e.g., at home). This lack of verbal communication interferes with educational or occupational achievement.

8. **Anxiety Disorder Due to Another Medical Condition**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Anxiety symptoms that are directly related to a medical condition (e.g., hyperthyroidism, chronic illness). The anxiety must be a direct physiological consequence of the medical condition.

9. **Substance/Medication-Induced Anxiety Disorder**:
   - **Key Symptoms**: Anxiety symptoms that develop during or shortly after substance intoxication or withdrawal, or after exposure to a medication. The symptoms must be severe enough to warrant clinical attention.

Hereâ€™s a summary of how it differentiates between Bipolar I, Bipolar II, and Cyclothymic Disorder:

### Bipolar I Disorder:
- **Definition**: Characterized by at least one manic episode, which may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes.
- **Manic Episode**: A distinct period of abnormally elevated, expansive, or irritable mood lasting at least one week (or any duration if hospitalization is necessary) and accompanied by at least three additional symptoms (e.g., increased energy, decreased need for sleep, grandiosity).
- **Impact**: The manic episode must cause significant impairment in social or occupational functioning or necessitate hospitalization to prevent harm.

### Bipolar II Disorder:
- **Definition**: Characterized by at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but no full manic episodes.
- **Hypomanic Episode**: A distinct period of elevated mood lasting at least four consecutive days, with similar symptoms to a manic episode but less severe and not causing significant functional impairment.
- **Impact**: The depressive episodes in Bipolar II can be more debilitating than the hypomanic episodes, leading to significant distress or impairment.

### Cyclothymic Disorder:
- **Definition**: Characterized by numerous periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms lasting for at least two years (one year for children and adolescents), but the symptoms do not meet the criteria for a hypomanic episode or a major depressive episode.
- **Symptoms**: The symptoms are chronic and can lead to significant distress or impairment, although they are less severe than those seen in Bipolar I or II disorders.
- **Impact**: Individuals may experience fluctuating mood states but do not have the more severe episodes characteristic of the other bipolar disorders.
